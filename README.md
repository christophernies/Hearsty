Hearsty
=======

A simple Python wrapper for the Hearst API.

So I went to the Hearst Fashion Hackathon February 8-10, 2013, and the company shared with the developers there an API they'd created to access Hearst data. Not having an easy method to access the API through Python, I figured I'd write a wrapper for it so that people can use it easily.

This is a work in progress, of course.
